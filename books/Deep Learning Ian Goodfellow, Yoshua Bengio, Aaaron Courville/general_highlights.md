# Introduction

## Representation matters
In computer science, operations such as searching a collection of data can proceed
exponentially faster if the collection is structured and indexed intelligently. 
People can easily perform arithmetic on Arabic numerals, but find arithmetic on 
Roman numerals much more time-consuming. It is not surprising that the choice 
of representation has an enormous effect on the performance of machine learning algorithms.

## Representation learning
Use machine learning to discover not only
the mapping from representation to output but also the representation itself.

The quintessential example of a representation learning algorithm is the au
toencoder. An autoencoder is the combination of an encoder function that
converts the input data into a different representation, and a decoder function
that converts the new representation back into the original format.
