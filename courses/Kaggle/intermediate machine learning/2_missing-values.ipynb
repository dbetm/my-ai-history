(_You also learned how to do this in the previous exercise.  If you need a reminder of how to do this, please use the instructions below._)  \n\nFirst, you'll need to join the competition if you haven't already.  So open a new window by clicking on [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course).  Then click on the **Join Competition** button.\n\n![join competition image](https://i.imgur.com/wLmFtH3.png)\n\nNext, follow the instructions below:\n1. Begin by clicking on the blue **Save Version** button in the top right corner of the window.  This will generate a pop-up window.  \n2. Ensure that the **Save and Run All** option is selected, and then click on the blue **Save** button.\n3. This generates a window in the bottom left corner of the notebook.  After it has finished running, click on the number to the right of the **Save Version** button.  This pulls up a list of versions on the right of the screen.  Click on the ellipsis **(...)** to the right of the most recent version, and select **Open in Viewer**.  This brings you into view mode of the same page. You will need to scroll down to get back to these instructions.\n4. Click on the **Output** tab on the right of the screen.  Then, click on the file you would like to submit, and click on the blue **Submit** button to submit your results to the leaderboard.\n\nYou have now successfully submitted to the competition!\n\nIf you want to keep working to improve your performance, select the blue **Edit** button in the top right of the screen. Then you can change your code and repeat the process. There's a lot of room to improve, and you will climb up the leaderboard as you work.\n\n\n# Keep going\n\nMove on to learn what **[categorical variables](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/categorical-variables)** are, along with how to incorporate them into your machine learning models.  Categorical variables are very common in real-world data, but you'll get an error if you try to plug them into your models without processing them first!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n\n\n\n*Have questions or comments?
