      "Skywatchers in Arizona, the moment you’ve waited all year for is here. The biggest meteor shower of 2025 is reaching an epic climax this week, sending dozens of shooting stars streaking across the night sky.\n",
      " The Perseid meteor shower peaks on Tuesday night into Wednesday morning and will put on a light show of shooting stars zooming through the night sky. The yearly celestial spectacle, which occurs every August, is known for causing 60 to 100 meteors per hour under ideal viewing conditions.\n",
      " A time-lapse photo of the Perseid meteor shower in 2016. Lukas Schlagenhauf/CC BY-ND 2.0/Flickr  in its waning gibbous phase, may wash out many of the fainter meteors. That being said, its still possible to see a larger than normal amount of burning fireballs zooming across the sky. What time is the meteor shower tonight? Here’s when to see the Perseid meteor shower in Arizona. click to enlarge\n",
      "What causes the Perseid meteor shower?\n",
      " The Perseid meteor shower is the result of the Earth traveling through the ice, rocks and other debris shed by Comet Swift-Tuttle. These tiny bits on interstellar matter will burn up in our atmosphere as our planet passes through the detritus each year. \n",
      "Why is called the Perseids?\n",
      " The Perseids get its name from the fact its shooting stars seem to originate near the constellation Perseus, which is the meteor shower’s radiant point.\n",
      "When is the Perseid meteor shower?\n",
      " The Perseid meteor shower occurs nightly through late August.\n",
      "When is the peak of the Perseid meteor shower?\n",
      " The Perseid meteor shower will peak on Tuesday, Aug. 12 into the early hours or Wednesday, Aug. 13.\n",
      "What’s the best time to see the Perseid meteor shower tonight?\n",
      " The best time to catch the Perseids is typically between midnight and dawn, under ideal circumstances. Thanks to the amount of light coming from the moon, which will be 84% full during the peak of the Perseid meteor shower, seeing a number of the shooting stars will be hampered. Astronomers suggest watching in the pre-dawn hours when moonlight won’t be as bright. Bottom line: You’ll still guaranteed to see meteors, just not as many as during a moon-free year.\n",
      "Where in the sky can you see the Perseid meteor shower?\n",
      " You’ll want to look north in the direction of Perseus, which will rise in the sky after midnight. \n",
      "What kind of meteors will I see during the Perseids?\n",
      " The Perseid meteor shower causes a series of fast, bright shooting stars zipping across the night sky. Some will even leave glowing trails that take a few second to burn up. \n",
      "How many meteors will I see during the Perseids?\n",
      " There’s a reason why the Perseid meteor shower in widely considered to be the biggest and most active of the year. Between 60 to 100 meteors light up the sky during the peak of the Perseids under ideal conditions. That being said…\n",
      " Lost Dutchman State Park east of Phoenix is a good spot to see the Perseids. Arizona State Parks\n",
      "Where can I see the Perseid meteor shower in Arizona?\n",
      " Essentially, anywhere with open skies that’s as dark as possible and far from city lights. You’ll want to head to the outskirts of metro areas like Phoenix or Tucson. Another option is the Estrella Star Tower, 8175 S. Hillside Drive in Goodyear, or any of the following local parks that near the edges of the Valley:\n",

      "What will Perseid viewing conditions be like in Arizona?\n",
      " As we said, viewing conditions will be a little dodgy this year due to all the moonlight. There's always the possibility of a summer storm blocking your view, even though the monsoon has been a non-factor this year. \n",
      "What are some other tips?\n",
      " Bring a chair or blanket to see as much of the sky as you can. It also helps to stow your phones for 15 to 30 minutes to permit your eyes to adjust to the dark.\n",

      "The peak of the Perseid meteor shower will fall on the mornings of August 11, 12 and 13. But a bright moon will be in the sky during the prime meteor-watching hours, from midnight to dawn. Is it possible to watch the Perseids in moonlight? Yes. Get some tips from 2 expert night sky-watchers, EarthSky’s Deborah Byrd and Bob King, aka AstroBob. The moon is bright! But we’ve got you covered. Watch in the player above, or on YouTube.\n",
      "Perseids peak mornings August 11 and 12\n",
      " Predicted peak: We recommend watching for Perseid meteors on the mornings of August 11, 12 and 13. The moon will interfere; it’ll be big and bright, in its waning gibbous phase, on these mornings. But you’re stuck with the moon, which will be up from late night until dawn. Perseid meteors tend to strengthen in number as late night deepens into the wee hours before dawn. The shower is often best just before dawn. Here are some tips for watching meteors in moonlight. And if you are watching for meteors before dawn, be sure to look east for the dazzling conjunction of Venus and Jupiter. They’ll be closest August 12. See the chart below.\n",
      "Radiant: The Perseid radiant rises in the middle of the night and is highest at dawn. See chart below.\n",
      "Nearest moon phase: The full moon fell at 7:55 UTC on August 9.\n",
      "Duration of shower: July 14 to September 1. This time period is when we’re passing through the meteor stream in space!\n",
      "Expected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: Under a dark sky with no moon, skywatchers frequently report 60 to 90 meteors per hour, or more. In 2025, due to moonlight, the American Meteor Society suggests you might see about only 25% of the expected peak rate, or perhaps 10 to 20 meteors per hour. The August Perseid meteor shower is rich and steady, from early August through the peak. The meteors are colorful. And they frequently leave persistent trains. All of these factors make the Perseid shower perhaps the most beloved meteor shower for the Northern Hemisphere.\n",
      "Report a fireball (very bright meteor) to the American Meteor Society: it’s fun and easy!\n",
      "The Perseids’ radiant point rises late in the evening around now, in the constellation Perseus. That’s why Perseids are best viewed from midnight to dawn. You’ll see the most meteors just before dawn, when the radiant is high in the sky.\n",
      "A Perseid meteor composite from John Ashley in Montana in 2016.\n",
      "Venus and Jupiter pair up during the Perseid meteor shower\n",
      "During the peak mornings of the Perseid meteor shower, brilliant Venus and bright Jupiter make a dynamic duo as they pass close to each other in the morning sky. They’ll create a spectacular scene in the east before sunrise. At their closest, they’ll be less than 1 degree apart. So if you extend your pinky at arm’s length, you’ll be able to hide both the planets behind it. The planetary duo rises a few hours before sunrise. Chart via EarthSky.\n",
      "Perseid meteor shower radiant point\n",
      "Around the peak mornings, if you trace all the Perseid meteors backward, they seem to come from the constellation Perseus near the famous Double Cluster. Hence, the meteor shower is named in honor of the constellation Perseus the Hero.\n",
      "Of course, there’s no real connection between the meteor shower radiant and the constellation Perseus. The stars in Perseus are many light-years distant, while these meteors burn up about 60 miles (100 km) above the Earth’s surface.\n",

      "The Perseids’ parent comet\n",
      "From the late, great Don Machholz (1952-2022), who discovered 12 comets …\n",
      "The parent comet responsible for the Perseid meteor shower is a rather large comet called 109P/Swift-Tuttle. The comet orbits the sun approximately every 133 years. Lewis Swift of Marathon, New York, visually discovered it on July 16, 1862, using an 11-centimeter (4.3-inch) refractor lens telescope. He did not report it immediately, believing that he was observing Comet Schmidt, which was found two weeks prior. Then, three days later, Horace Tuttle picked it up from Harvard Observatory. Scientists calculated that the comet would return in 120 years. That is, that we would see it again in 1982.\n",
      "So, 1982 came and went. And the comet didn’t show up. Oops! It was back to the drawing board, and this time, the appearance of a comet observed in 1737 was considered a possible early appearance of the comet. Now, the orbital period was more like 130 years. Brian Marsden published new orbital elements and an ephemeris as to where to find it for its 1992 return.\n",
      "In the 1980s, many of us visual comet hunters would, from time to time, cover the part of the sky where the incoming comet was supposed to appear. The 1991 outburst of Perseid meteors indicated that the comet was probably on its way back. Another meteor outburst in 1992 seemed to confirm that.\n",
      "On September 26, 1992, Tsuruhiko Kiuchi, an amateur astronomer and comet hunter, picked up the comet in the evening sky just north of the bowl of the Big Dipper. Knowing where to look, I observed this comet 16 hours later and made a brightness estimate 5 times brighter than the original report. Others then confirmed this. Later, Gary Kronk suggested that the comets observed in 69 BCE and 188 CE were also appearances of this comet, a theory later confirmed.\n",
      "Do Perseid meteors ever hit the ground?\n",
      "Meteors that hit the ground intact are called meteorites. But few – if any – meteors in annual showers become meteorites. That’s primarily because of the flimsy nature of cometary debris. Comets are made of ices. Most meteorites, on the other hand, are the remains of rocky or metallic asteroids.\n",
      "In ancient Greek star lore, Perseus is the son of the god Zeus and the mortal Danaë. It was said that the Perseid shower commemorates the time when Zeus visited Danaë, the mother of Perseus, in a shower of gold.\n",
      "So think of the ephemeral nature of meteors in meteor showers, as you stand outside watching for Perseids in 2025. Most meteors strike Earth’s atmosphere unseen. You can consider any Perseid meteor you do see in 2025 as there for your viewing pleasure!\n",
      "By the way, 2023 was a fantastic year for the Perseids: Enjoy this gallery of Perseid meteor photos from around the world, 2023.\n",

      "What is the Perseid meteor shower, when does it happen and how can I see it in 2025?\n",
      "The Perseid (Per-see-id) meteor shower is one of the most dramatic things to see in the night sky between July and August, and is a highlight of many meteor hunters’ calendars due to its high hourly rate and bright meteors.In 2025 the Perseid meteor shower is active between 17 July and 24 August. The shower will peak 12 August.Find out how to see the spectacular display below.

      " What is the Perseid meteor shower?\n",
      "As comets get close to the Sun, they heat up and pieces break off. If the debris ends up in the Earth’s path around the Sun, it can slam into our atmosphere at speeds of between 7–45 miles per second. The actual speed at which a meteor enters our atmosphere depends on the combined speed of the Earth and the debris itself.The average speed for a Perseid meteor is 36 miles per second. The air in front of the meteor is squashed and heated to thousands of degrees Celsius. The smaller meteors vaporise and leave behind a bright trail of light. Larger meteors can explode as fireballs.Giovanni Schiaparelli was the first to realise the connection between meteor showers and comets. Lewis Swift and Horace Tuttle discovered a new comet (which now bears their names) two years before Schiaparelli announced that the orbit of this comet coincides with the path that the source material for the Perseids take. Find out the difference between an asteroid, a comet, a meteor, and a meteorite in the video below.\n",

      " How to see the Perseid meteor shower\n",
      "You can look out for the Perseids wherever you are, but there are certain kinds of places that will increase your chances of spotting meteors.Plan ahead and check the weather forecast. If it is likely to be inclement, find a different location or go out on a different day. The days leading up to the peak are usually better than the days after.Reduce the amount of light pollution in your field of view. This could mean heading out to the countryside, a nearby park or even turning your back to street lamps if you're not able to go anywhere. Give your eyes at least 15 minutes to adjust to the dark so that you can catch more of the fainter meteors – this does mean that you should avoid looking at your phone!Meteors can appear in any part of the sky so the more of the sky you can see, the better. Find an area with a clear view of the horizon away from trees and buildings. Binoculars and telescopes are not necessary as they will restrict the size of the sky that will be visible to you.The meteors will seem to originate from the constellation of Perseus. You can use a stargazing app to find the exact location you should look.What time is best to see the Perseid meteor shower?The radiant of the Perseids is actually always above the horizon as seen from the UK, which means that observers in the UK should be able to see some meteors as soon as the Sun sets. Therefore, it is worth looking up in the early evening.The best time to see the Perseids is between 12:00 midnight and 5:30am.It is always ideal to try to spot meteors when the Moon is below the horizon or when it is in its crescent phase, otherwise it acts as natural light pollution and prevents the fainter meteors from being visible. In 2025 the peak of the Perseid meteor shower is three days after Full Moon, so conditions are unfortunately not favourable for seeing the peak.Why should you look out for the Perseids?The Perseid meteor shower is one of the best meteor showers of the year because it produces bright meteors and is one of the most active. There's also a high chance of seeing fireballs, which are very bright meteors, as well as meteors with long trains during the Perseid meteor shower.How to photograph the Perseid meteor shower\n",

      "Myths, legends and associations with the Perseid meteor shower Perseus was a hero who beheaded the Gorgon Medusa and later married Andromeda according to Greek Myths. They had nine children together and the word ‘Perseids’ is derived from the Greek word ‘Perseides’ which refers to Perseus’ descendants.In some Catholic traditions, the Perseids is also known as ‘the tears of St Lawrence’, due to its peak roughly coinciding with the date the Saint achieved martyrdom.The Perseids are also associated with the god Priapus, who was believed by the Romans to have fertilized the fields by ejaculating on them once a year on the date the shower peaks.Main image: The Perseid Fireball 2018 by Zhengye Tang\n",

      "A meteor shower is a celestial event in which a number of meteors are observed to radiate, or originate, from one point in the night sky called Radiant. These meteors are caused by streams of cosmic debris called meteoroids entering Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds on parallel trajectories. The Meteor Data Center of the IAU lists over 900 suspected meteor showers of which about 100 are well established.\n",
      "The meteor showers listed below are the easiest to observe and provide the most activity. Particular attention should be noted to the time and moonlight conditions. All these showers are best seen after midnight. Some are not even visible until after midnight. Showers that peak with the moon’s phase greater than one half illuminated (first quarter to last quarter) will be affected by moonlight and difficult to observe.\n",
      "While the time each shower is best seen remains much the same year after year, the moonlight conditions change considerably from one year to the next. As we approach the date of each shower's maximum, be sure to consult the latest AMS article about Meteor Showers, which will provide in depth information on each shower and how to best view it.\n",
      "When is the next meteor shower?\n",
      " Well, first of all you need to know that the Perseids are currently active until Saturday 23rd August 2025.\n",

      "The Perseids are the most popular meteor shower as they peak on warm August nights as seen from the northern hemisphere. The Perseids are active from July 14 to September 1. They reach a strong maximum on August 12 or 13, depending on the year. Normal rates seen from rural locations range from 50-75 shower members per hour at maximum. The Perseids are particles released from comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle during its numerous returns to the inner solar system. They are called Perseids since the radiant (the area of the sky where the meteors seem to originate) is located near the prominent constellation of Perseus the hero when at maximum activity. In 2025, the waning gibbous moon will severely compromise this shower at the time of maximum activity. Such conditions will reduce activity by at least 75 percent as only the brighter meteors will be visible. \n",

      "The Leonids are best known for producing meteor storms in the years of 1833, 1866, 1966, 1999, 2001 and 2002. These outbursts of meteor activity are best seen when the parent object, comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle, is near perihelion (closest approach to the sun). Yet it is not the fresh material we see from the comet, but rather debris from earlier returns that also happen to be most dense at the same time. Unfortunately, it appears that the earth will not encounter any dense clouds of debris until 2099. Therefore, when the comet returns in 2031 and 2064, there may not be any meteor storms, but perhaps several good displays of Leonid activity when rates are in excess of 100 per hour. Each passing year also presents new possibilities from old debris fields. In 2024, the waning gibbous moon will rise during the late evening hours and will spoil the best viewing hours for this shower.\n",

This is the one major shower that provides good activity prior to midnight as the constellation of Gemini is well placed from 22:00 onward. The Geminids are often bright and intensely colored. Due to their medium-slow velocity, persistent trains are not usually seen. These meteors are also seen in the southern hemisphere, but only during the middle of the night and at a reduced rate. In 2025, the moon will have a waning crescent phase on December 13/14, which rises near 2am local standard time. Observations prior to this time will be moon-free. Observations after moon rise can still be successful by facing westward with the rising moon at your back. . \n",

Observers will normally see 5-10 Ursids per hour during the late morning hours on the date of maximum activity. There have been occasional outbursts when rates have exceeded 25 per hour. These outbursts appear unrelated to the perihelion dates of comet 8P/Tuttle. This shower is strictly a northern hemisphere event as the radiant fails to clear the horizon or does so simultaneously with the start of morning twilight as seen from the southern tropics.In 2024, a half-illuminated moon will be present in the morning sky and will obscure the fainter meteors. \n",

The average hourly rates one can expect under dark skies is 25. These meteors usually lack persistent trains but often produce bright fireballs. Due to the high northerly declination (celestial latitude) these meteors are not well seen from the southern hemisphere. Predictions for 2026 show a peak near 00:36 UT on January 4th. This timing favors Asia..Activity will be severely compromised in 2026 as a full moon occurs on January 3rd.

      "Final Answer: The Perseids Meteor shower 2025 is currently active until August 23, 2025, with the peak occurring on August 12-13, 2025. The shower is associated with Comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, and the radiant is located near the constellation Perseus. The Perseids are known for their bright and colorful meteors, with a normal rate of 50-75 per hour at maximum. Unfortunately, the moon will be 84% full during the peak, which may reduce visibility. Attendees can expect swift meteors with speeds of 37 miles/sec. Other upcoming meteor showers in 2025 include the Orionids, Southern Taurids, Northern Taurids, Leonids, Geminids, Ursids, Quadrantids, Lyrids, eta Aquariids, Southern delta Aquariids, and alpha Capricornids. Attendees should plan ahead and find a dark location with clear visibility to maximize their meteor viewing experience.\u001b[0m\n",

       "The Perseids Meteor shower 2025 is currently active until August 23, 2025, with the peak occurring on August 12-13, 2025. The shower is associated with Comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle, and the radiant is located near the constellation Perseus. The Perseids are known for their bright and colorful meteors, with a normal rate of 50-75 per hour at maximum. Unfortunately, the moon will be 84% full during the peak, which may reduce visibility. Attendees can expect swift meteors with speeds of 37 miles/sec. Other upcoming meteor showers in 2025 include the Orionids, Southern Taurids, Northern Taurids, Leonids, Geminids, Ursids, Quadrantids, Lyrids, eta Aquariids, Southern delta Aquariids, and alpha Capricornids. Attendees should plan ahead and find a dark location with clear visibility to maximize their meteor viewing experience."
