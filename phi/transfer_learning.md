# Tranfer Learning

Situation where what has been learned in one setting is exploited to improve generalization in another setting.

Transfer learning is an application of a research problem to a machine learning problem and not an algorithm or technique.

Transfer learning is different from traditional machine learning, as it uses pre-trained models that have been built with some task `Ts` as an input to be used for another task `Tt` in a way that will help to jump-start the development process for tast `Tt`.

## Adventages:
1. Reduced training time, by using some of the modules of an already developed model to a new one.
2. Usefulness in scenarios in which there is not sufficient data to train a model for desired results.
